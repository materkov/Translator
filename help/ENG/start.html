	<p>It's very easy to start working with program. Create new project (<b>Program -> New project</b>). You can change name and destination, if you want. Press <b>OK</b> button.
	<p>Project will be created, and new program will be added automatically. Yot can write code here.
	<p>We have simle rules. Every digit is a error (so, we have 10 error types), any other symbol is correct.
	<p>	Then you can give translation command (<b>Compile -> Projecr</b>). In errors window you can view all errors in project.
